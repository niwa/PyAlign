Input file for ALIGN5

Agreement:
ALIGN is a code for the simulation of misaligned cube-corner interferometers. It is a software
intended to use together with LINEFIT. For scientific, non-commercial use you may use ALIGN for free.
Please, do not pass on ALIGN to colleagues, instead refer them to me or Thomas Blumenstock. 
We intend to keep some overview concerning the distribution of ALIGN, this allows us to inform
all ALIGN users about software upgrades or about any problems experienced by one of them in
using ALIGN. In developing ALIGN, I tried to exclude any faulties and the software has been checked
vs. different radiation transfer codes and vs. a direct ILS deconvolution approach developed by 
Anton Lengel (IMK) for the MIPAS-B experiment. Therefore ALIGN results should be trustworthy.
Nevertheless, the author and IMK refuse any warranties with respect to the use of ALIGN. 
In no event shall the author or IMK be responsible for any direct, indirect or consequential damages.
